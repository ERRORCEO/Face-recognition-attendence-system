### Face-recognition-attendence-system

Automating attendance is a task that is generally overlooked.  Biometrics based attendance system produced approximately 3.8 seconds of execution time on average while the manual method of attendance produced approximately 17.8 seconds of execution time on average [1]. The amount of time it takes to complete the attendance of 200 students may take more than 20 minutes.
That is about 33% of the lecture time. We hope to reduce this time by implementing a face recognition attendance system using which, the students give their attendance through facial recognition. This is not only scalable to detect all faces at once, but it reduces the time significantly.
This project uses openCV and dlib packeged inside the face-recognition python library for facial encoding and detection. Hence, this very simple project shows how easy it is to develop a facial recognition system today.
